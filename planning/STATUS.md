## 2026-07-08 (later) — v0.3.0 released

- PR #2 merged to `main` as `9c35474`; CI fully green (a fresh RUSTSEC batch
  was fixed in-flight: anyhow → 1.0.103, crossbeam-epoch → 0.9.20,
  ttf-parser unmaintained ignored + registered as TD-17).
- GitHub Pages enabled by the owner; book live at
  <https://sakarzaidan.github.io/lumina/> including the new Events chapter.
- Tags pushed: `v0.1.0` (02b92da), `v0.2.0` (596b847), `v0.3.0` (9c35474);
  GitHub Release v0.3.0 created with showcase media as assets (D-010).
- WS-01 complete. Next up: WS-02 backend parity (v0.4) — see ROADMAP.

## 2026-07-08 — Repo audit, planning system, hygiene batch

- Full three-track engineering audit completed (core crates, tooling/CI, docs/git).
- This planning system created; `todo.md` retired into [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md);
  blueprint and history moved under `planning/`.
- Hygiene batch in flight on `feat/v0.3.0-enhancements`: metadata fixes, crate
  rustdoc, README/CHANGELOG repair, community health files, mdBook v0.3.0 refresh.
- Git state at session start: `origin/main` = `7af221a` (v0.3.0 merge, **CI red
  6/8** — fixed by the two `ci:` commits on this branch); no tags existed.
- Batch complete: 10 commits; local gate green (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`,
  92/92 tests, rustdoc clean, mdBook 0.4.40 builds).
- MSRV probed: **1.88** (1.78 and 1.85 fail on locked deps `home`/`image`);
  declared as `rust-version` and reflected in the README badge.
- Next: PR → green CI on `main` → tag `v0.1.0` (02b92da) / `v0.2.0` (596b847)
  backdated + `v0.3.0` on the green merge → GitHub Release for v0.3.0.
- Blocked on repo owner: enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source:
  GitHub Actions) so the deploy-docs job can publish the book.
- Version: 0.3.0 across workspace and both SDK manifests (drift fixed).
